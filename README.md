# Reinforcement-Learning---Maze

Reinforcement Learning Project: Maze Extended

We create a maze for an agent to navigate out. The agent learns from the environment via q-learning.

Initially, there is only horizontal and vertical movement. In the extended code, we include diagonal movements and increase the map size to 8 by 8, and make the maze more complicated. However, the concept remains the same.
