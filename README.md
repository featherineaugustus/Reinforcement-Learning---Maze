# Reinforcement-Learning---Maze

Reinforcement Learning Project: Maze Extended

We create a maze for an agent to navigate out based on Q-learning.

- Agent: Robot
- Environment: Maze
- State: Position of the Robot in the Maze
- Action: Movement
- Reward: 100 at goal, 0 otherwise

Initially, there is only horizontal and vertical movement. In the extended code, we include diagonal movements and increase the map size to 8 by 8, and make the maze more complicated. However, the concept remains the same.

The original code is extracted from:
